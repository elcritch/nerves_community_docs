# nerves_community_docs

Docs for various Nerves related topics (unofficialy). This repo contains notes of various things I've run into when using the (excellent!) [Nerves Project](https://nerves-project.org/) for various projects. As such don't expect great grammar and feel free to add PR's with little tidbits you might have run across. My goal is to accept whatever people want to add. 

There are lots of little gotcha's when dealing with IoT style hardware.
